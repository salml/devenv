## Fresh Mac Installs
### Preinstall
Download [homebrew](https://brew.sh), use it to download `git`, then setup your [SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to clone this repo.

### Install
Run `setup_install.sh`, which will
- Copy some dotfiles from the repo to their appropriate places
- Install some stuff with `brew (cask)`
- Install `oh-my-bash` to make the terminal pretty
